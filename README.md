# The Redeclaration of Independence

As human history unfolds, it becomes feasible and necessary for people to dissolve their economic bands to nation-states, whose power to issue fiat currencies are rooted in their monopoly on violence and often exploited by the privileged few.

We the Sovereign Individual, in order to form a more perfect economic Union, insure the Equality of all stakeholders, preserve the Economic Value of our labor, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish a crypto asset, the Sovereign Individual Reserve (SIR).

We believe that the just value of any credit money, fiat or crypto, must derive from its utility provided for its volunteer holders, and not from trickery, coercion, or the threat of violence. The goal of SIRs is to develop a liquid, stable, and environment-friendly crypto reserve that tracks the long term real return of a diversified portfolio of productive assets, and can be exchanged with any other currency at a minimum cost.

We agree that the total supply of SIRs is permanently capped at 3,141,592,653, that the price of SIRs will be determined by willing buyer and seller on a decentralized open market, that anyone is free to join and leave this economic Union at any time, that no stakeholders shall exploit or impose their will on others through voting or any other governance arrangements.

This agreement is codified and enforced by Smart Contract on Stellar Blockchain.
